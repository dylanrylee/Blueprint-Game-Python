# Blueprint Game in Python

MRU COMP 1501 Assignment 4

### What the program does
This is a program that reads a txt.file and reads the formation of the dices and calculates the number based on how many points each dice gives.

### What I did
- Designed and implemented a robust I/O system for extracting data from a text file in specified folders seamlessly. 
- Developed functions for parsing and structuring data to optimize retrieval and manipulation processes. 
- Created a point calculation subsystem for dice-based gameplay mechanics, including an algorithm to determine points based on dice color, and level, with results displayed on a new text file the program creates.
